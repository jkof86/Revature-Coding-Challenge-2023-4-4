Java:

Given an object containing counts of both upvotes and downvotes, return what vote count should be displayed. This is calculated by subtracting the number of downvotes from upvotes.

Examples

getVoteCount({​​​​​​​​​​​​ upvotes: 13, downvotes: 0 }​​​​​​​​​​​​) ➞ 13

 getVoteCount({​​​​​​​​​​​​ upvotes: 2, downvotes: 33 }​​​​​​​​​​​​) ➞ -31

getVoteCount({​​​​​​​​​​​​ upvotes: 132, downvotes: 132 }​​​​​​​​​​​​) ➞ 0

Notes

You can expect only positive integers for vote counts.



JavaScript:

There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. Return that value.

Examples

remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1

remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3

remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9

remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0

Notes


	
The tests only use positive and negative integers.
	
Don't forget to return the result.
	
	 
	
C#:

	
Given an n-sided regular polygon n, return the total sum of internal angles (in degrees).

	
Examples

	
SumPolygon(3) ➞ 180

	
SumPolygon(4) ➞ 360

	
SumPolygon(6) ➞ 720

	
Notes
	
	
n will always be greater than 2.
	
The formula (n - 2) x 180 gives the sum of all the measures of the angles of an n-sided polygon.
	
	
Python:

	
Create a function that takes length and width and finds the perimeter of a rectangle.

	
Examples

	
find_perimeter(6, 7) ➞ 26

	
find_perimeter(20, 10) ➞ 60

	
find_perimeter(2, 9) ➞ 22

	
Notes
	
	
Don't forget to return the result.
